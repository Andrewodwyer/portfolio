                        <strong>Star Squadron</strong> is an interactive JavaScript game inspired by the classic Nintendo game StarFox. This project showcases my skills in front-end web development, game design, and interactive user experiences. The game combines character selection and a rock-paper-scissors gameplay to create an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience.

                    <p>
                        I began the process by evaluating the user experience of similar games and identifying common pain points. Many games in this genre suffered from issues such as complex mechanics and lack of intuitive navigation. This gave me insight into what could be improved for <strong>Star Squadron</strong>, focusing on simplicity and accessibility.

                  <p>
                      My design strategy was focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing game that would be easy for players to pick up and play. I prioritised a simple yet strategic gameplay loop, ensuring that players would be engaged without feeling overwhelmed. The goal was to combine a retro space theme with modern design principles, resulting in a game that was both nostalgic and fresh.

                    <p>
                        I started by creating wireframes that outlined the basic layout and flow of the game. These low-fidelity sketches helped me visualise the user experience and structure the different gameplay screens and interactions.

                    <h5 class="text-center thin-text">High-Fidelity Prototyping</h5>
                    <p>
                        After the wireframes, I designed high-fidelity prototypes using <strong>Figma</strong>. These prototypes featured the visual elements, including the space-themed background, character designs, and UI elements. I wanted the design to feel immersive while ensuring that the interface remained clean and user-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="text-center thin-text">UI Design</h5>
                    <p>
                        The visual design was a key aspect of the project. I used a colour palette that matched the original game, blues, purples, and greens. I also designed custom icons for each gameplay action, buttons, for rock, paper and scissors.

                    <p>
                        After developing the initial prototype, I conducted user testing to gather feedback on the gameâ€™s mechanics, interface, and overall enjoyment. The feedback was positive, with players enjoying the ease of play and visual design. However, based on their suggestions, I made refinements to improve the tutorial and I made the character selection more intuitive.

                  <p>
                      With the design finalised, I then moved on to the development phase, where I implemented the gameplay logic using <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I made sure the game was responsive, lightweight, and played smoothly across different devices. After the development was complete, I launched the game and monitored user feedback, addressing any issues that arose and ensuring a smooth post-launch experience.

                        Key takeaways from this project include the importance of designing with simplicity,
