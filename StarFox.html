                        **Star Squadron** is a browser-based game I designed and developed, blending the mechanics of rock-paper-scissors with an engaging space combat theme. The game allows players to select characters with unique attributes and engage in strategic battles, set against a dynamic space backdrop.

                        As both the designer and developer, I took complete ownership of this project. From conceptualising the gameplay to creating the user interface, implementing the game logic, and crafting visual assets, I handled every aspect of the process.

                    <p>
                        I began the process by evaluating the user experience of similar games and identifying common pain points. Many games in this genre suffered from issues such as complex mechanics, lack of intuitive navigation, and long loading times. This gave me insight into what could be improved for **Star Squadron**, focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and speed.

                  <p>
                      My design strategy was focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing game that would be easy for players to pick up and play. I prioritised a simple yet strategic gameplay loop, ensuring that players would be engaged without feeling overwhelmed. The goal was to combine a retro space theme with modern design principles, resulting in a game that was both nostalgic and fresh.

                    <h5 class="text-center thin-text">Wireframing</h5>
                    <p>
                        I started by creating wireframes that outlined the basic layout and flow of the game. These low-fidelity sketches helped me visualise the user experience and structure the different gameplay screens and interactions.

                    <h5 class="text-center thin-text">High-Fidelity Prototyping</h5>
                    <p>
                        After the wireframes, I designed high-fidelity prototypes using **Figma**. These prototypes featured the visual elements, including the space-themed background, character designs, and UI elements. I wanted the design to feel immersive while ensuring that the interface remained clean and user-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="text-center thin-text">UI Design</h5>
                    <p>
                        The visual design was a key aspect of the project. I used a futuristic colour palette with cosmic blues, purples, and neon greens to give the game a space-age feel. I also designed custom icons for each gameplay action to enhance the thematic experience.

                    <p>
                        After developing the initial prototype, I conducted user testing to gather feedback on the gameâ€™s mechanics, interface, and overall enjoyment. The feedback was positive, with players enjoying the ease of play and visual design. However, based on their suggestions, I made several refinements to improve the tutorial, make the character selection more intuitive, and adjust the difficulty curve of the AI opponent.

                  <p>
                      With the design finalised, I then moved on to the development phase, where I implemented the gameplay logic using **JavaScript**. I made sure the game was responsive, lightweight, and played smoothly across different devices. After the development was complete, I launched the game and monitored user feedback, addressing any issues that arose and ensuring a smooth post-launch experience.

                        **Star Squadron** received positive feedback from players who enjoyed the nostalgic yet fresh gameplay experience. The game was praised for its intuitive interface, engaging mechanics, and smooth performance. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in both UX/UI design and front-end development, while delivering a seamless, engaging game.
